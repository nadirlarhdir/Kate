# KATE - Kicking Autism Through Entertainment

KATE is a therapeutic video game for the treatment of autism through human-machine interaction. 
KATE's objective is two-fold: on the one hand, the game contributes to the social rehabilitation of children, and on the other hand, it is scientific, as it makes it possible to advance the research into the treatment of autism through video games.

## Getting Started

How to go through our analysis?

We recommend to first go thorugh the Kinect part, which was done first (since the first version of the game was for Kinect).

Starting with the Kinect analysis in the following order:

0) Optional: Data parsing file
1) Data visualization
2) K-Neighbors
3) Neural Network
4) TPOT Analysis

Then go to the Hololens analysis

5) Optional: Data Parsing:
6) Data visualization
7) K-neighbors
8) TPOT Analysis
9) Autoencoder Classifier

### Prerequisites

To use our codes, you will be requiring specific python packages. These include

```
json
numpy
pandas
glob
seaborn
sklearn
matplotlib
mpl_toolkits
sklearn
```

### Installing

Most of these packages can be installed by using the pip3 command, assuming you are working on a Python3 framework. 

As an example for seaborn, the following command can be executed in your terminal
```
pip3 install seaborn
```
## Running the tests

You are now ready to run our programs either in a Jupyter Notebook form or the standard .py form
